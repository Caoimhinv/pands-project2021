Fisher’s Iris data set

Problem statement
This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set [3]. You must research the data set
and write documentation and code (in Python [1]) to investigate it. An online search for
information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it
previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that
are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.
You might do that for this project as follows:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
• outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
• saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
• outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

Just finding my feet!
Getting used to accessing, reading, parsing the data.
Did some simple calculations. Overall average measurements and then individual averages for each species.
Did a simple scatter plot - no idea the relevance just yet!
Think I'll carry on like this for a while and see where it leads!

After pandas lecture I discovered a few new tricks which make things a lot simpler! Firther investigation of pandas required! Now I have this new data, I need to try and understand what it means!

Intro
So we're dealing with a dataset introduced by statistician Ronald Fisher and collected by botanist Edgar Anderson. It consists of 50 samples from each of three species of iris - Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. Four elements were measured from each - petals and widths of sepals and petals.
